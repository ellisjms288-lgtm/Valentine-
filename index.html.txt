    <h1>Happy Valentine’s Day, Kaz ❤️</h1>

    <p>There’s something about you that’s hard to explain — not loud, not flashy… just real.</p>
    <p>The way you care. The way you notice small things. The way you try, even when you’re tired or busy. It’s inspiring.</p>
    <p>Some days, you might not realize how much of a difference you make to the people around you. But I want you to know: your presence matters. Your heart matters. You matter.</p>
    <p>Even in quiet, ordinary moments, you bring warmth, comfort, and light. It’s in the little things — your smile, your laugh, your thoughtfulness.</p>
    <p>I hope you know how much you’re appreciated and how much love surrounds you, even if it isn’t always said out loud.</p>
    <p>You make life better for everyone who has the chance to know you. You inspire, you care, you support, and you bring joy just by being yourself.</p>
    <p>So today, I hope you pause for a moment and feel it: the love, the gratitude, the admiration for everything that you are.</p>
    <p>From your kindness to your quiet strength, I admire you more than you’ll ever know. And I hope this message reminds you that you are truly special. 🌻</p>
